Outline of Talk
    - Collaborative Work with Dan...
    - How did I get on this project?
        - fMRI lab
        - Saw how little they were using the CT analytically
            - but the data is everywhere

Stroke - Ischemic vs. Hemorrhagic
- Description of Data/Trial

    - Why CT? - protocol
    - CT vs. MRI
        - Multiple Scanners
        - Not as big of a concern
        - Do analysis by scanner type

Data Analysis 
    - First - Skull Stripping
        - Literature out there
        - Use BET and simple thresholding
            - MRI labs - oh yeah that's easy
            - Clinicians - some mind blown, most in the middle
        

    - Only one scan - not multi-modal or multi-sequence
        - have to derive descriptors


Model
    - Random forest worked well
        - likely due to high collinearity of terms
    - simple logistic regression did almost as well
        - 
Better approaches
    - PCA on the design matrix
    - Lasso or some regularization 
        - PCA + lasso
